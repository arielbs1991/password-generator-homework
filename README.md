# password-generator-homework

In this project we created a site on which we prompted users for a set of criteria to be used in creating a randomly generated password. We were able to accomplish this with a series of prompts and confirms that set character length and seleted arrays and concatenated them into a larger array, from whence we randomly generated strings to be printed on the page.
